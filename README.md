# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project involves using Python libraries and code to analyze a dataset related to COVID-19. The goal is to identify common trends, highlight data quality issues, and correct these problems to enhance data quality while finding useful insights.

## Overview

The analysis aims to:
- Identify and report skewness present in the dataset variables.
- Detect and correct inconsistencies or errors in the data.
- Answer specific questions related to COVID-19 data.

## Key Questions and Analysis

1. **Average BMI of COVID-19 Positive Patients from the US**:
   - Calculate the average Body Mass Index (BMI) of patients from the US who have tested positive for COVID-19.

2. **Country with the Highest Risk of Mortality**:
   - Identify which country has the highest average risk of mortality related to COVID-19.

3. **Countries with at Least 10 Positive Cases**:
   - Determine how many countries have reported at least 10 positive COVID-19 cases.

4. **Top-Five Countries by Number of Positive Cases**:
   - List the top-five countries according to the number of positive COVID-19 cases.

## Data Quality Assessment

- **Skewness Report**:
  - Identify and report the skewness present in the dataset variables to understand the distribution of the data.

- **Error Identification**:
  - Detect inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.
  - List identified errors and detail how they can be addressed to improve data quality.
